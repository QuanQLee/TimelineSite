/**
 * Normalize an identifier (as found in references, definitions).
 *
 * Collapses markdown whitespace, trim, and then lower- and uppercase.
 *
 * Some characters are considered 鈥渦ppercase鈥? such as U+03F4 (`洗`), but if their
 * lowercase counterpart (U+03B8 (`胃`)) is uppercased will result in a different
 * uppercase character (U+0398 (`螛`)).
 * So, to get a canonical form, we perform both lower- and uppercase.
 *
 * Using uppercase last makes sure keys will never interact with default
 * prototypal values (such as `constructor`): nothing in the prototype of
 * `Object` is uppercase.
 *
 * @param {string} value
 *   Identifier to normalize.
 * @returns {string}
 *   Normalized identifier.
